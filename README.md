# crystax-pypi
crystax-pypi aims at overcoming the lack of 3rd-party modules in Python-3 for Android distributed as part of [CrystaX](https://www.crystax.net/) NDK. This repository covers only a tiny subset of [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) and there is defenitely no goal to cover them all. Also it is not a goal to provide here support for Python-2. If you cannot find here the module you are looking for, feel free to submit a new issue about.
## typical use:
```$NDK/prebuilt/${platform}/opt/python3.5/python setup.py <package-name> --build --install```
